# Introduction
## About The Data

<hr>

This report utilizes a database with ~3 million records of powerlifting meet data worldwide. Powerlifting, a globally and nationally competed sport, involves lifters maximizing weight in three key lifts over a set period (typically six months). These lifts, recognized as strength benchmarks, have existed for over a century.

## Key Lifts

These lifts include...

-   **Barbell Bench Press** \| An upper-body lift using the chest, triceps, and shoulders to press a barbell off the chest. A good lift is smooth, level, and free of excessive glute movement.

<hr>

-   **Barbell Back Squat**\| A lower-body lift engaging the quads, glutes, and core to squat a barbell from the shoulders. Proper form includes good posture, smooth motion, and depth (knee crease below 90Â°).

<hr>

-   **Barbell Deadlift**\| A full-body lift pulling a barbell from the ground to lockout. A good deadlift is smooth, with minimal jerking and proper posture.


## Questions

After inspecting this data, I have been left with two questions:

1.  **What is the difference between Age & Weight classes on their progression from Raw to Unlimited equipment lifts? Why might this be?**

<hr>

2.  **What is the difference of pound-for-pound strength versus total strength when looking at different weight classes? Why might this be?**

# Question One:
<hr>
**What is the difference between Age & Weight classes on their progression from Raw to Unlimited equipment lifts? Why might this be?**

## Overview

Aims to see how progressing equipment levels affect the performance of different Age & Weight classes.

## Q1 | Visulization - Weight 

Total Leaders/Visualizations by Weight  


```{r}
q1_plot_weight(power, "BodyweightKg", "TotalKg", "Total By Weight", "Weight-(kg)", "Total-(kg)", 1300, 200)

```

## Q1 | Data - Weight 

```{r}
weightclass_leaders(power, "TotalKg")
```


## Q1 | Visulization - Age


```{r}
q1_plot_age(power, "Age", "TotalKg", "Best Total by Age", "Age", "Total (kg)", 1300, 200)
```

## Q1 | Data - Age

```{r}
ageclass_leaders(power, "TotalKg")
```


## Conclusions

- Weight and age categories show substantial differences as lifters transition into better equipped lifts.

<hr>

- Equipment appears to have little effect on strength gains.

<hr>

- The greatest strength development is seen in the 10-20 years age group, with peaks in strength in the subsequent age group, then declining after that.

<hr>

- This is observed across all types of machinery.

<hr>

- In weight classes, Multi-ply and Unlimited equipment show more linear strength progress.

<hr>

- There is no clear advantage to equipping since most top players use very little equipment.
Overall, age and weight classes are more relevant to strength gains than equipment.


# Question Two:
<hr>
**What is the difference of pound-for-pound strength versus total strength when looking at different weight classes? Why might this be?**

## Overview
Aims to compare two different metrics of strength across different weight classes:

- **Total**
  - Cumulative weight of lifters lifts (Bench, Squat, Deadlift)

<hr> 

- **Pound-for-Pound Ratio** (p4p)
  - A lifters total divided by their body weight, great indicator of strength for those who may be genetically disadvantaged. 

## Q2 | Visulization - Total

## Q2 | Visulization - p4p
```{r}

 ggplot(aes(x = BodyweightKg, y = p4p)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = Sex, linetype = Sex), method = "gam", se = FALSE) +

  labs(
    title = "p4p Ratio by Bodyweight",
    x = "Bodyweight-(kg)",
    y = "p4p Ratio"
  ) +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1.5, linetype = "longdash"),
        axis.text = element_text(face = "bold"))

```


## Q2 | Data - p4p
```{r}
leaders_general(power, "p4p")
```


## Conclusions

- Lower-weight classes tend to show greater p4p strength potential in elite lifters.

<hr>

- Higher-weight classes see a decrease in p4p strength but an increase in total strength.

<hr>

- p4p and total strength changes are not proportional but somewhat perpendicular.

<hr>

- Strength doesnât directly correlate with weight but with the "type" of weight (e.g., muscular vs. adipose tissue).

<hr>

- A lifter with more active weight (muscle/skeleton) is likely stronger than one with passive weight (fat).

<hr>

- Weight is not a direct indicator of strength; too much weight can be detrimental.

<hr>

- In powerlifting meets where p4p is used, excessive weight can hinder performance, as it affects the p4p ratio rather than total lifted weight.
