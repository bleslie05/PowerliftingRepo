If you wish to render these files on your own, first download the dataset from the open powerlifting database from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-powerlifting/powerlifting-database?resource=download)
Make sure you select the larger of the two csv files (500mb plus), and set the "read_csv()" function to that file-path. Also install neccesarry packages (like tidyverse, todymodels, etc.)
